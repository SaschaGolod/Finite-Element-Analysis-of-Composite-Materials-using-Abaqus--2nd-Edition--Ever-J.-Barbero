I created this repository as a tribute to Barbero for his excellent book. I appreciate his high-quality material and want to express my gratitude.

His original website can be found here: https://barbero.cadec-online.com/feacm-abaqus/

I have copied his files to help keep them up to date.

All credits go to Barbero. I did not create these files.
